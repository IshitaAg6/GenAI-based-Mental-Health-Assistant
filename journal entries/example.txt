Hi dear diary , its been a week since I have talked to you . Today was a weird day . It all began with me falling down the stairs and having a swollen foot. I also received the news that I lost in a compeition but in the end I received such a good news.It really made my day . We are going to Goa this week for vacations . Its gonna be a 1 week long trip. All's well that ends well . Bye !
